A calculator written to practice building lexers/parsers, and also writing data structures such as hash table and trie.

It supports variables, matrices, strings, conditions, loops and :break/:next, functions (that persist when loading another chunk of code), and function-local variables.

It compiles expressions to bytecode which is then executed on a virtual machine. It has a primitive reference-counting garbage collector for non-scalar types.
