A calculator written to practice building lexers/parsers.

It supports variables, matrices and user-defined operators and functions.

It compiles expressions to bytecode which is then executed on a virtual machine. It even has a primitive reference-counting garbage collector for matrices.

It also supports first-class functions, although currently there is little use of this feature.

Basically this is more like an early stage of yet another programming language.
